Ultimate Secure Cash (USC)
 

Ultimate Secure Cash (USC) is a secure , nearly instant cryptocurrency. It will pays very big role in the business world and that it also should play a very big role in the world of cryptocurrencies. 

After watching many many coins, we noticed a trend creating basic coin without any special function . Those kind of coins wont bring any inovation to the world of crypto currencies. Ultimate Secure Cash (USC) has its own local community that will support its liquadity . Premine and PoW block created for our angel investors  which is generally will become our main suporters . We created a completely risk free coin because we hedge coin value in some big local companies . Instead of contributing all coins right in the beginning, we choose to distribute USC by working closely with big companies . Our goal is it to avoid an instant dump, instead creating bigger and bigger attention with the target to grow a bigger and bigger community.
